**Employee Performance Analysis – Power BI Project**
This project showcases a **comprehensive Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze and visualize employee performance across multiple departments. The main objective was to provide HR and management teams with actionable insights into employee productivity, salary trends, attendance, and performance ratings to support data-driven workforce decisions.

**Project Development Process**

**Data Collection & Preparation:**
I started with an employee dataset containing details like department, salary, attendance, performance rating, projects completed, overtime hours, and age. The data was cleaned, formatted, and structured for Power BI analysis.

**Data Modeling**:
Relationships between tables were created (Employee, Department, and Performance tables) to ensure seamless filtering and interaction between visuals. DAX measures were used to calculate KPIs like **average salary, attendance percentage, average performance, and project counts**.

**Dashboard Design:**
The Power BI dashboard was designed with an **interactive layout**, allowing users to filter by department, gender, year, or employee ID. Key visuals include:
Salary trends by year
Overtime hours and projects completed by performance rating
Department-wise average performance value
Employee distribution by performance category (bottom tier, average, star performer)
Department salary contribution

**Insights & Outcomes:**
The dashboard provides a clear view of workforce dynamics — helping identify **top-performing departments**, monitor **attendance patterns**, and evaluate **salary-performance correlations**. HR teams can use these insights to improve **employee engagement, rewards, and resource allocation**.

**Tools & Skills Used**
**Power BI** for dashboard creation and data visualization
**DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for calculated measures and KPIs
**Excel / CSV** for data preprocessing and import
**Data Modeling** & **Visualization Design Principles**.
